Prisma
======

**Prisma** is live visual software that was developed for presenting visuals
in a live performance by Merzbow & XXX Residents at DMM VR Theater.

The basic design of this project is much similar to my previous project
[Mirage], but it's heavily optimized in several ways.

The biggest difference in performance wise is introducing Shadow Slicer that
makes it possible to render shadows on the background screen without
re-generating shadow maps. For further details, see the [source code of Shadow
Slicer].
